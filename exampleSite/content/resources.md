Hello! Welcome to the list of software and hardware that I use in my day to day as a software engineer. Every day I get a few emails asking about the specifics of some piece of tool I use. I direct them to this place. 😉

I've also made a list of web technologies that I use on this blog.

Don't forget to bookmark this page as I frequently update this page with new shiny objects that I use as part of my daily 🤓
