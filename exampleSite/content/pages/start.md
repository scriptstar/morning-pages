I read [5 pages a day](https://5pagesaday.com) from a book that interests me every day and then write about my thoughts. I always wanted to read more, but creating such high-value habits are very hard to form.

> "A **reader** lives a thousand lives before he dies"

Regular writing is another habit that I want to develop, so I decided to make the whole world as my accountability partner. Join me on my journey.

> I may read more than five pages, but I read at least 5 pages a day

When I am writing, I will present you with these five aspects of the book.

1. Key Takeaways
2. Notable Quotes
3. Vocabulary
4. Catchy words
5. References

Below you will find different series links to each book I read. They are self-explanatory. Click on a series link which will show individual book reding posts within a book. Enjoy!
